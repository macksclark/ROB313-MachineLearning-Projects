The file containing all of the code for this assignment is called
a4.py and is stored in the same directory as this file and the report.
The main portion to be looked at when executing this file is the 
__main__() block at the bottom of the code. The first variables in 
the main execution block are Q3, Q4, Q5, and Q6. These are booleans 
that, when set to true, run the code for their respective questions 
in the A4 handout.

The code uses the matplotlib standard library, as well as autograd
and the autograd numpy version, which must be downloaded through
anaconda on Python 3.7. The datasets are imported using the 
load_dataset () function provided in the data_utils.py file, so 
this must be in the location ./data/data_utis.py

In the command line, the command to execute the script is:
	python a4.py
which will execute the appropriate portions of the code based on
the booleans set in the __main__() block.
